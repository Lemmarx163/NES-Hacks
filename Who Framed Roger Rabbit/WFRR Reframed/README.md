**Description**

This is an improvement hack of Who Framed Roger Rabbit for the NES. The original game is famous for its insane difficulty whether it is just for wandering 
around the map without being crushed by snakes, birds, cars, or being continuously chased by weasels with no time to select a good punchline, to finally face an 
utterly unfair boss fight that gives aching hands. Well, everybody knows what it is all about. The hack feature a revised punching mechanism that allows holding 
the B button to increase the power meter. It also buff damage done to Judge Doom, not only with the punch, but also with the throwable items making them usable 
against it. Don't forget to meet with Jessica at the Ink & Paint Club, she might have some hints to give.
